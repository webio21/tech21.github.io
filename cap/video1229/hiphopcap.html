<b>Make a correction here. "Bow your head immediately after spreading your arms." So the action of bowing the head occurs after spreading the arms, rather than simultaneously with spreading the arms (the arms are spread while the body leans forward slightly, resembling a slight bow, followed immediately by the head bowing motion, then transitioning from a distance to close-up, focusing on the badge on the front of the hat while the dancer is bowing). This detail was not explicitly explained in the video. Additionally, the fixed pose at 0:10 seconds only needs to resemble the image provided. As for the other parts where creative freedom is allowed, there are no specific requirements; we only need to provide dance footage that meets the final duration of approximately 35 seconds, possibly a bit longer, from which I will select usable material totaling 35 seconds.</b><br><br><br>
We can derive the desired dance sequence from this demo video, It looks simple for you, dancing part about 35 sec, requiring only your imaginative interpretation to choreograph to the accompanying music. The theme blends elements of aliens and eagles. At the crucial moment, the eagle will gracefully extend its wings, seamlessly integrating with hats, dance movements, and the background music, leaving a lasting impression.<br><br>
To amplify the atmosphere, we'll employ mysterious dark lighting, employing Rembrandt lighting techniques to create a dark, enigmatic ambiance. Light will cascade from above, veiling the face in perpetual obscurity, which can be accentuated with a black mask. Close-up shots of the front and side embroidery will be captured during your dance, enhancing the visual allure of the performance.<br><br>
Maybe You need to wear with hoodie hood and blank mask, as long as and the hat with will be at your disposal, no special requirements, please do not worry, sure, you can also be start with me before confirming your dress and the scene.<br><p>
